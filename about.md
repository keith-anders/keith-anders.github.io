## About Me

I am a software engineer located in the Salt Lake valley and a firm believer in [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development). I love improving the process of creating useful applications, and I have a special fondness for writing development tools (VisualStudio extensions, code weavers, etc...) especially in the .NET Framework. If you have a question about any content on [my blog](https://thedevelopingcoder.com/) or just want to learn more about me and what I believe and practice, check out my profiles in the social media links above.

Thanks, and happy improving!


Keith Anders
