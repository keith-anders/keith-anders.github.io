<p class="alert alert-warning"><b>Announcement:</b> Effective 26 August 2018, I'll be blogging as I have time instead of on any regular schedule. I simply have too much going on in my life to put out a post of any quality on a consistent basis.</p>

## Planned

- Unit Test Frameworks in C#, Part Five: Advanced Assertion Frameworks. Various assertions that are only available in a small number of frameworks, and those frameworks' extensibility points.
- Unit Test Frameworks in C#, Part Six: Advanced Features. Data-driven tests in MSTest. Various extensibility points in NUnit and xUnit. Possibly an introduction to Moq or Autofac.
- Null. A discussion on Sir Anthony Hoare's billion dollar mistake.
- Git commands.

## Parking lot of ideas for future posts

- Walk-through of Castle DynamicProxy, one of the most powerful libraries for the .NET Framework.
- A discussion on the practice of requiring an engineering team to add intellisense comments to every code element.
- Design patterns
- Why I don't like the term "Technical Debt".
- A discussion on unit testing versus integration testing.
- The biggest difference between a software engineer and a computer programmer.
- We all know the Agile Manifesto, and the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto is also popular. I have an idea for a Developing Coder's Manifesto.
- Performance diagnostics. Some notes on lessons learned from trying to fix a performance problem.
